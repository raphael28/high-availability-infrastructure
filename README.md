# High Availability Infrastructure

Data Center Infrastructure Project 2019/20, Computer and Software Engineering Course @ University of Minho, Braga - Portugal

The main goal of this project is the implementation of a high scalable infrastructure telemetry service.

The final service must:
  * be `scalable`
  * `not have single points of failure`
  * provide an `overview of the state` of the infrastructure and services provided
