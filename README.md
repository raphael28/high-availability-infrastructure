# High Availability Infrastructure

The main goal of this project is the implementation of a high scalable infrastructure telemetry service.

The final service must:
  * be `scalable`
  * `not have single points of failure`
  * provide an `overview of the state` of the infrastructure and services provided

## Main used applications

  * [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)
  * [collectd](https://collectd.org)
  * [graphite](http://graphiteapp.org)
  * [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
